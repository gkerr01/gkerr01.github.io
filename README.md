    <h3> About me </h3>
    As a person, I am naturally honest and polite and enjoy working
    amongst a team despite potential personality clashes. I am laid back
    and hardworking and strive to deliver the best result for each and every
    task I am set. My laid-back nature combined with my determination to be
    successful is a complimentary trait because it offers flexibility in the
    sense I can work effectively either by myself or as part of a team. I am
    not afraid to try anything as I have always completed tasks to the best of
    my ability and carry this optimistic and enthusiastic attitude throughout
    all aspects of my life, particularly my work.  Furthermore, I am
    well-mannered and build good relations because of this, my mature mentality
    allows me to manage situations in a professional and helpful way whilst
    also being considerate of the effect of actions and emotions of people around me.
